### BACKLOG (not prioritized)
- [ ] Flow Stats API - exercise through acceptance tests
- [ ] Integration Testing with external ISL Filter
- [ ] Representative production deployment picture
- [ ] Re-route verificiation through simulator, virtual, staging
- [ ] Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-sim (simulator)
- [ ] Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-virtual (containers)
- [ ] Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-staging (real switches)
- [ ] Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-prod (smoke tests)
- [ ] Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-perf (perf tests)
- [ ] Add AT - Resilience Test - speaker outage (network partition) - light load, heavy load
- [ ] Add AT - Resilience Test - speaker bounce (restart) - light load, heavy load
- [ ] Add AT - Resilience Test - storm topology LCM
- [ ] Add AT - Troubleshooting - validate FLOW deployment status updates through CLI
- [ ] Add AT - Perf Test - stress test at "production" scale - 200 switches, 400 flows, small health check intervals (1s) .. metrics (queues, logs, resources)
- [ ] Data Path Validation
- [ ] Latency Statistics
- [ ] Topology Statistics (up/down)
- [ ] Specify key troubleshooting use cases for 1.0 and implement through CLI (implementation tasks as separate items)
- [ ] Refactor Message Passing (ie generalize CLI mechanisms, correlation ID) - eg add common base class, add SRC, Response Requested, etc.
- [ ] Refactor Topologies - Message paths / leverage new features in refactored Messaging.
- [ ] Refactor Topologies - eliminate boilerplate mechanisms in topology body, leveraging fluent style
- [ ] Refactor Bolts - move logic to library classes
- [ ] Confirm during 'make unit' that components are wired together properly
- [ ] Refactor Topologies - have the unit tests leverage the junit / mock environment (working in tandom with externalize business logic into libraries)
