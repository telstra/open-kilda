# 0.9 Release Detailed Notes

## Top Priorities

The priorities are stack ranked - more important items come before less important items

### REQUIRED - 0.9.0 - ~Jan 08
- [ ] 05: Operations - Consildate logging into something like an ELK stack (Issue #107)
- [ ] 05: Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-sim (simulator), and move/add ATs
- [ ] 03: Add AT - Resilience Test - speaker outage (network partition) - light load, heavy load (document bugs)
- [ ] 03: Add AT - Resilience Test - speaker bounce (restart) - light load, heavy load (document bugs)
- [ ] 05: Add AT - Resilience Test - storm topology LCM
- [ ] 05: Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-perf (perf tests) (does not count the production scale test)
- [ ] 05: Add AT - Perf Test - stress test at "production" scale - 200 switches, 400 flows, small health check intervals (1s) .. metrics (queues, logs, resources)
- [ ] 05: Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-staging (real switches)
- [ ] 05: Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-prod (smoke tests)
- [ ] 03: Evolve ATDD test stages - atdd-virtual (containers) (cleanup / reduces set vs simulator ATs)
==> 44

### DESIRED 0.9.1 - ~Jan 29
- [ ] 05: Refactor Topologies - have the unit tests leverage the junit / mock environment (working in tandom with externalize business logic into libraries)
- [ ] 02: Representative production deployment picture
- [ ] 03: Add AT - Troubleshooting - validate FLOW deployment status updates through CLI
- [ ] 03: Health Check Improvements - validate the logic of when health checks are sent, honoring policies, etc. (Issue #85)
- [ ] 05: Specify key troubleshooting use cases for 1.0 and implement through CLI (implementation tasks as separate items)
- [ ] 03: Integration Testing with external ISL Filter
- [ ] 02: Path Verification Improvements - handlePacketIn (Issue #65)
- [ ] 03: Add At - Re-route verificiation through simulator, virtual, staging
- [ ] 05: Refactor Bolts - move logic to library classes
- [ ] 05: Refactor Message Passing (ie generalize CLI mechanisms, correlation ID) - eg add common base class, add SRC, Response Requested, etc.
- [ ] 05: Refactor Topologies - Message paths / leverage new features in refactored Messaging.
- [ ] 05: Refactor Topologies - eliminate boilerplate mechanisms in topology body, leveraging fluent style
==> 46

### OUT OF SCOPE
- [ ] 03: Flow Stats API - exercise through acceptance tests
- [ ] 03: Confirm during 'make unit' that components are wired together properly
- [ ] 05: Latency Statistics
- [ ] 05: Topology Statistics (up/down)
- [ ] 10: Data Path Validation
==> 26
