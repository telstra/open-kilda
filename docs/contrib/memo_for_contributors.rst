What to Remember When Contributing To Open-Kilda
================================================

This document describes several important things which should be done before
submitting a pull request (PR) to Open-Kilda.

 - Don't forget to make sure your change does not break anything -- run unit
   and acceptance tests before making a PR;

 - Please, include meaningfull commit message;

 - If you were working on an issue and your commit resolves it, please add
   a reference to the issue to your commit message (for example, if you were
   working on issue #9978796 you could add 'Resolves #9978796' to commit
   message);

 - If you are willing to add a new feature it makes sense to discuss it
   with other contributors first. This could be done in multiple ways,
   for example etherpad could be used for this purpose. After discussion
   please add a blueprint for the feature to docs/blueprints.
