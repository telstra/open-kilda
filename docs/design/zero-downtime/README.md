# Zero Downtime Upgrades for OpenKilda

## Rationale

The current deployment process requires a time slot with no reactions from the control plane for any network events because 
flow and switch operations are not available. To improve this, a new deployment procedure is proposed.
The details of this procedure are described in this document.

## Solution

Provide the ability to deploy OpenKilda in a so-called blue/green mode. This will allow to quickly switch the
system between different release versions. However, due to the event-driven nature of OpenKilda and a number of
limitations from Apache Storm, It is required to tweak the standard Blue/Green approach.

### Shared Transport

OpenKilda uses Kafka as a Message broker and messages in it to communicate between components of the system.
To provide backward compatibility between green and new versions of OpenKilda within the same Kafka topic
we need to distinguish messages using some value between new and old ones. For this purpose, there will be a Kafka message
header with run ID encoded in it. Run ID is supposed to be unique within a single deployment.
Each component will emit messages with the run ID header that is valid for the given deployment. All receiver parts
should validate a message header first and verify that the run ID matches its configuration. In that case, the component
will handle the message. Kafka provides an API to write custom interceptors for both consumer and producer. This
interceptor will be responsible for verifying the deployment ID.

### Zookeeper to store the state

Since Storm has limitations on lifecycle of its topologies, a new mechanism is required to deal with topologies states. 
In addition, it should be responsible for handling graceful shutdown procedure for topologies. Apache Zookeeper
looks like a good fit for this role.

#### Node structure for Zookeeper

`/kilda/{component_type}/{env_id}`: root for every component process, where:
`component_type` is a topology or service name, e.g. `floodlight`, `network`, `nbworker`, and
`env_id` is a flag of blue or green env.

#### Signal, States and Build-Version

Each component (except Northbound and GRPC and a root node) will have 3 children zNodes:
- signal: input field, can be `START` or `SHUTDOWN`, it is a way to make the component start emitting or processing new events;
- state: int, a number of active subcomponents of a component, when `SHUTDOWN` is emitted, the value is `0`, otherwise it is a positive number;
- build-version: string field with the run ID, could be changed on fly, see [Shared transport](#shared-transport) for details
For a long-running task, such as hub in hub and spoke topologies, there should be a way to stop receiving new
requests, finishing up existing, and after that decrementing counter by 1 in a state field.

#### Basic Deployment Scenario:

*Note*
For this upgrade procedure each switch should be connected to 2 floodlights simultaneously.
 
Floodlights could be distinguished by a region. Let's assume that all odd regions are green and all even are blue.
For the scenario below, suppose that `blue` is the current env and `green` is the one to be deployed.
Based on that the process is the following:

- Ensure that `signal` for the `green` components is set to `SHUTDOWN` and the `build-version` is updated  
- Deploy green topologies  
- Set `SHUTDOWN` signal for `green` floodlights 
- Redeploy floodlight containers of `green` color
- Send `START` for the following `green` components:
  - NB Worker
  - Switch Manager
  - Flow HS
  - Reroute
  - Ping
  - Floodlight Router
  - Connected Devices
  - ISL Latency
  - Port State
  - Server 42 Control
  - Stats
- Send `START` for `green` Floodlights
- Emit `SHUTDOWN` for the network blue
- Emit `START` for the network green
- Deploy Green Northbound(forward new requests to it from customer)
- Redeploy grpc containers of `green` color
- *Important* a decision Point: if everything works and env upgraded is accepted, the following steps are required
- Set `SHUTDOWN` signal for `blue` floodlights
- Set new `build-version` for the left floodlights
- Redeploy `blue` FL containers
- Set `START` signal for `blue` Floodlights (now they become `green`)
- Terminate `blue` topologies

If during the process something goes wrong, it is required to perform a fallback at the decision point.
The rollback process to the blue network topology is the following:
- Redeploy `blue` northbound,
- Rollback `green` floodlight containers back to `blue` version,
- Rollback GRPC to `blue` version.

#### Post Deployment phase

Once a deployment is finished the last thing to be made is the removal of consumer group offsets for the `blue` environment,
so the next release recreate them for the `blue`.

### Example of local zero downtime deployment

##### Build stable and latest images. Deploy stable images

```shell
make clean build-stable GRADLE_COMPILE_PARAMS="-x test"  build-latest GRADLE_COMPILE_PARAMS="-x test" up-stable
```

NOTE: the following commands will be executed with the help of ZooKeeper CLI bash script.
You can download zookeeper from [here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/zookeeper/):
* Download ZooKeeper sources (we used version 3.6.2)
* Extract sources from `zookeeper-***.tar.gz`
* Run CLI `./apache-zookeeper-3.6.2-bin/bin/zkCli.sh` to connect to local ZooKeeper
* If you need to connect to remote ZooKeeper run `./apache-zookeeper-3.6.2-bin/bin/zkCli.sh -server server1,server2`

After connecting to Zookeeper Server successfully, you can run following commands from CLI to manipulate OpenKilda components:

#### Send START signal to blue components
