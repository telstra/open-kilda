# OpenFlow cookies data

The length of a cookie field is 64. It is divided into several bit groups. Some bit fields are system-wide, i.e. have same meaning for possible cookies. Other bit fields are specific for a specific cookie type (some subset of cookies).

## System wide cookie fields
This is a set of basic fields that are present in all cookie types.

```

* S - SERVICE_FLAG (1 bit): if OF flow marked with 1 in this bit, then it is a service flow.  OpenKilda uses it to manage service traffic: ISL detection, ISL health check, loops prevention, etc.
* T - TYPE_FIELD (9 bit): contains a cookie type code. This type defines the existence and layout of all other bit fields in the cookie.


## Generic cookies (org.openkilda.model.cookie.CookieBase)
This cookie format was the only existing format in OpenKilda from the beginning. It does not put any restrictions on a cookie format, and it can be used to read a "raw" cookie value to determine its actual type.

## Service cookies (org.openkilda.model.cookie.ServiceCookie)
Fields:
