# Switch connected devices via LLDP 

## Summary

This feature allows to detect devices connected to a particular switch by catching LLDP packets.
Design of the feature is based on multi-table feature design.

## API

A new boolean field `switch_lldp` will be added to switch properties.
After setting it to `true` by API `PUT /{switch-id}/properties` several rules will be installed on the given switch.
You can find descriptions of these rules in the section [Detecting connected devices via LLDP](#detecting-of-connected-devices-via-lldp).

Due to the switch LLDP feature is based on the multi-table feature, a user cannot set the `switch_lldp` property
to `true` without setting `multi_table` to `true`. Bad request will be returned otherwise.

A new API will be created to get a list of devices connected to Switch: `GET /{switch_id}/devices?since={time}`

* `switch_id` - Switch ID
* `since` - Optional param. If specified only devices which were seen since this time will be returned.

This API returns following body:

~~~json
{
  "ports": [
      {
         "port_number": int,
         "lldp": [{
            "vlan": int,
            "macAddress": string,
            "chassisId": string,
            "portId": string,
            "ttl": int,
            "portDescription": string,
            "systemName": string,
            "systemDescription": string,
            "systemCapabilities": string,
            "managementAddress": string,
            "flowId": string,
            "timeFirstSeen": string,
            "timeLastSeen": string
           },
           ***
         ],
      },
      ***
   ]
}
~~~

The following fields are optional:

* portDescription
* systemName
* systemDescription
* systemCapabilities
* managementAddress
* flowId

## Detecting connected devices via LLDP

To detect connected devices via LLDP we will catch LLDP packets from each switch port
and send them to the controller to analyze them in Connected Devices Storm Topology.

There are three types of switch ports:
1. Customer (port with created flow on it).
2. ISL
3. Other (port without ISL and without flows).
 
Rules will be different for each port type.

## Switch rules

There are 7 types of new rules will be introduced:
* Flow (1 rule for each flow and 3 default rules)
* ISL (1 default rule)
* Other (2 default rules)

One Switch Flow rule will be changed to mark packets from One Switch Flow (by 0x0020 metadata)

#### Flow rules

Rule for each flow in Input Table:
```
[FLOW_ID0]
    ofp_version      = 4
    ControllerGroup  = Management
    [MATCHFIELDS]
        OFPXMT_OFB_ETH_DST = 01:80:C2:00:00:0E (LLDP packet mac address)
        OFPXMT_OFB_ETH_TYPE = 0x88CC (LLDP eth type) 
        OFPXMT_OFB_IN_PORT = XXX (flow input port) 
    [INSTRUCTIONS]
        [OFPIT_APPLY_ACTIONS]
             [ACTIONS]
                [OFPAT_WERITE_METADATA]
                    value = 0x0001 (mark packet as LLDP)
                    mask = 0x0001
                [OFPAT_GO_TO_TABLE]
                    table_id = 2 (ingress table)

```

Rule for One Switch Flows in Post Ingress table:
```
[FLOW_ID0]
    ofp_version      = 4
    ControllerGroup  = Management
    [MATCHFIELDS]
        OFPXMT_OFB_METADATA = 0x0003 (packet marked as LLDP and as One Switch Flow)
