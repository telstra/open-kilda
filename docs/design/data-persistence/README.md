# OpenKilda Persistence Layer

## Overview
Kilda has a well-defined persistence layer which provides access to the data in the system database / graph storage.
The layer consists of API and the actual implementation of its components (storage implementations, repositories, 
persistence context and transaction managers).

This doc describes the components, approaches, and solutions used in the persistence layer.

The persistence layer consists of several areas (at this moment `COMMON` and `HISTORY`). Each area is tied to a specific
persistence implementation via configuration options. Each area provides capabilities to store different kinds of
data in different databases. For example, `COMMON` area can be stored into OrientDB, while `HISTORY` area can be stored into MySQL.

## Entities
Persistent entities are classes whose instances can be stored in the database / graph storage. 
The entities' interfaces are defined by OpenKilda Model, while the Persistence Layer encapsulates the logic required to perform 
CRUD operations with the entities' data.

Kilda Model and Persistence Layer utilize the [Data Gateway](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/rowDataGateway.html) pattern
to separate the business logic from the code of data mapping, converting, and persisting. This approach simplifies state transition 
for entities: from transient to managed, and back.

Basically, there are 3 states of an entity:
- Transient - an entity has just been instantiated (by default or copying constructor, via a builder) 
and is not associated with a persistence context. Or when a persistent entity has been removed from a repository.
- Persistent - an entity is obtained from a repository or added to a repository.
- Detached - a persistent entity becomes detached on closing a persistence context associated with the entity.

## Persistence Context
A Persistence Context defines boundaries between which Persistence Layer maintains the entity state.
When you get or add an entity via a repository, the entity is associated with the current Persistence Context. 
This Persistence Layer propagates the entity state changes to the database / storage. 

If two entity instances point to the same database / storage object, and they are both associated with the same Persistence Context, 
the Persistence Layer guarantees that their states are synchronized. 

**Important points about Persistent Context:**
- Persistence Layer doesn't guarantee fetching of lazy-load relations / sub-entities for detached entity or beyond a Persistent Context scope.
- Persistence Layer doesn't synchronize any changes made to a detached entity or beyond a Persistent Context scope.

## Repositories
[Repositories](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) encapsulate the data access functionality, 
providing a better abstraction for the persistence layer implementation. 
They act like a collection of domain model objects in memory, perform the role of an intermediary between 
the domain model and the database / storage.

A repository allows you to fetch data from the database into memory in the form of the domain entities,
add new entities, or remove existing. Once the entities are in memory, they can be changed and then persisted back 
to the database / storage.

Each repository relates to one persistence area. Using this relationship, the Persistence Layer decides which persistence
implementation must be used.

## Transaction Management
A transaction in the Persistence Layer represents a unit of work. The unit of work (UoW) isolates changes in a transaction scope
from other threads until the changes are successfully committed to the database / storage. If any persistence operation fails
or the UoW code throws an exception, the whole transaction fails.

Kilda-transaction queries a transaction adapter from a specific persistence implementation. This adapter is used to manage
the state of the real DB transaction. OpenKilda-transaction will deny attempts to use multiple persistence implementations
simultaneously. I.e. there is only one "real" transaction managed by OpenKilda-transaction.

## Tinkerpop implementation
The current implementation of the Persistence Layer supports [Tinkerpop-enabled](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) storages, and relies on the [Ferma framework](http://syncleus.com/Ferma/).

The persistable piece of data in Ferma Framework is called frame; in OpenKilda, it is a Java class extending one of the base frames: Vertex or Edge frames. 
This provides a level of abstraction for interacting with the underlying graph using Ferma Framework methods that operates on Frame objects.
