# Strict bandwidth flag for flow

## Overview
Now, when a flow cannot fit into the existing bandwidth during a rerouting operation,
Reroute topology decides to retry the rerouting operation with the `ignore_bandwidth` flag.

## Problem
With this approach, we cannot control which flows will occupy the bandwidth of other flows. 
We need to be able to prevent Reroute topology from setting this flag when retrying the rerouting operation.

## Solution
Implement a new `strict_bandwidth` flag for flow that will not allow manipulation 
of the `ignore_bandwidth` flag on retries during the rerouting operation.

## Reroute retry result

## NB contract changes
Create\Update Flow Request: add optional `strict_bandwidth` flag. 
If both the `ignore_bandwidth` and `strict_bandwidth` flags are set in the request, 
we should receive a `BAD_REQUEST` error in the response.

## DB changes
Flow entity keeps `strict_bandwidth` flag as a property.

## Reroute topology changes
If the `strict_bandwidth` flag is set, the `ignore_bandwidth` flag will not be set when retrying the rerouting operation.
