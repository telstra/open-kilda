# Flow H&S reroute retry

## Current implementation
Current flow reroute retry implementation has few issues:
* Logic duplication. Reroute requests are merged two times: in Reroute Throttling Bolt (Reroute topology) and in Retry Manager (flow H&S topology).
* The way Retry Manager injecting retries into processing is not clear. Service layer call is masqueraded as transport layer message.

## Flow reroute retry in Reroute Topology

This solution is aimed to fix mentioned above issues.

FlowRerouteQueueBolt is a single point for flow reroute requests queuing and merging. New reroute queue should combine time-based throttling and in-progress reroute tracking. For this purpose following data structure is used:

| flow-id | in-progress | pending  | throttling |
| ---     | ---         | ---      | ---        |
| 1       | request1    | request2 | request3   |

Flow reroute FSM should save error reason with retryable flag and FlowRerouteQueueService will check this flag and retry counter to decide will system emit reroute retry request or not.
