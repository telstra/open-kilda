@Narrative("""
This test suite verifies the ability to create diverse flows in the system. Diverse flows are flows that should not 
overlap at all or the overlapping should be minimal. Such flows form a so-called diversity group. Ideally, the diversity 
group should not have flows with overlapping paths. But it depends on the cost of paths. The paths of flows from 
the same diversity group may overlap if the cost of each non-overlapping path is more than the cost of the overlapping 
path. The cost of paths for diverse flows is calculated in real time and consists of the following parameters: 

1. The cost of ISL involved in the flow path (taken from DB);
2. (diversity.switch.cost) * (the number of diverse flows going through this switch);
3. (diversity.isl.cost) * (the number of diverse flows going through this ISL). 

Refer to https://github.com/telstra/open-kilda/issues/1231 for more details.
