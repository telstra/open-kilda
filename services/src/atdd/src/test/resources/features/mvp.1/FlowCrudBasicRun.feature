  Scenario Outline: Flow Creation on Small Linear Network Topology

    This scenario setups flows across the entire set of switches and checks that these flows were stored in database

    When flow <flow_id> creation request with <source_switch> <source_port> <source_vlan> and <destination_switch> <destination_port> <destination_vlan> and <bandwidth> is successful
    Then flow <flow_id> with <source_switch> <source_port> <source_vlan> and <destination_switch> <destination_port> <destination_vlan> and <bandwidth> could be created
    And flow <flow_id> in UP state
    And rules with <source_switch> <source_port> <source_vlan> and <destination_switch> <destination_port> <destination_vlan> and <bandwidth> are installed
    And traffic through <source_switch> <source_port> <source_vlan> and <destination_switch> <destination_port> <destination_vlan> and <bandwidth> is forwarded

    Examples:
      | flow_id |      source_switch      | source_port | source_vlan |   destination_switch    | destination_port | destination_vlan | bandwidth |
