# Discovery
# - discovery.interval = how many bolt ticks(1 tick per second) between ISL discovery / health checks, starts from 0
# - discovery.timeout = at which point do we send an ISL Failure (if it is an ISL)
#       - NB: the number is in "ticks", not "attempts" .. attempts = timeout/interval
# - discovery.limit = at what point do we stop sending? -1 means never ..
# - discovery.speaker-failure-timeout - after this amount of seconds without a
#   message from speaker it will be marked as unavailable
# - discovery.keep.removed.isl - how long should we store/remember in minutes isl endpoints.
#   it is mainly used for defining whether isl is moved or not
